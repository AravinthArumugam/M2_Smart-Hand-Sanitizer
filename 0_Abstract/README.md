## ABSTRACT 
The main aim of this research is to design a smart hand sanitizer dispenser that dispenses optimum amount of sanitizer based on the palm image processing with enhanced IoT features. The research problem of this project is the hand sanitizer dispenser mostly provided in manual dispenser. This will make the hand sanitizer dispenser to be contaminated. The usage of the hand sanitizer also controlled by the individual behaviors. They may use it very little which will not achieving the purpose of using it to curb the infectious virus. They may also use is too much and it can be wasted. The method used to achieve the objectives of this project is by using the Raspberry Pi B+. The system is implemented by using Haar Cascade Classifier to detects the hand palm and measure the hand by using Euclidean distance and pixels per metrics. The system also consists of monitoring and alert features. The liquid level of hand sanitizer is monitored by using Node-RED. An alert system also constructs to remind the owner to refill the hand sanitizer. Other than that, PIR sensor is used to detect the presents of human in the nearby and give out a message through speaker to remind people using the hand sanitizer.
