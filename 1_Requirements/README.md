# **SMART HAND SANITIZER**

## INTRODUCTION:

     The "Smart Hand Sanitizer" is an automatic hand sanitizer that detects an object using an ultrasonic sensor. This hand sanitizer is suitable for both individuals and businesses, as it employs IoT to track the number of users based on the amount of strain exerted to the hydraulic pump.
     
     The goal of creating this tool is to reduce direct contact with other users, and we hope that it will assist a firm or individual in determining the number of users of this tool so that they can determine whether the location of this hand sanitizer was appropriate. As a result, they could relocate to a more efficient location where they could reach a bigger number of individuals.
     
## COMPONENTS:

  *Atmega328
  
  *Vibration sensor
  
  *Ultraseonic sensor
  
  
## ATMEGA MICROCONTROLLER 
   
      The Atmel 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller includes 32 KB ISP flash memory with read-while-write capabilities, 1 KB EEPROM, 2 KB SRAM, 23 general-purpose I/O lines, 32 general-purpose working registers, 3 flexible timer/counters with compare modes, internal and external interrupts, serial programmable USART, a byte-oriented 2-wire serial interface, SPI serial port, 6-channel 10-bit A/D converter
      
## VIBRATION SENSOR 
 
      A piezoelectric sensor is another name for a vibration sensor. These sensors are adaptable devices that are used to measure a variety of processes. This sensor employs piezoelectric effects to measure changes in acceleration, pressure, temperature, force, or strain by converting them to an electrical charge. This sensor is also used to determine fragrances in the air by measuring capacitance and quality in real time.
      The sensitivity of these sensors typically ranges from 10 mV/g to 100 mV/g, with lower and higher sensitivities available. The sensor's sensitivity can be chosen based on the application. As a result, it is critical to understand the levels of vibration amplitude range to which the sensor will be subjected during measurements.
      
## ULTRASONIC SENSOR 

     An ultrasonic sensor is an instrument that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves.
An ultrasonic sensor uses a transducer to send and receive ultrasonic pulses that relay back information about an objectâ€™s proximity.  
High-frequency sound waves reflect from boundaries to produce distinct echo patterns.

## ADVANTAGES 

  * Time required is less

  * Fast functioning
  
  * Accessible and Portable

  * Soft, cold and fragrant

  * Affordable and long lasting

  * Low cost 

## DISADVANTAGES 

  * Some brands are futile

  * Useless on dirt

  * Sanitizers kill bacteria (Bad as well as the good ones) 

  * Not safe for children

  * Flammable in nature 
  
## OBJECTIVES 

  The main objective of this research paper is to design and implement a low cost touch free smart hand sanitizer dispenser with door controller that includes features such as ultrasonic sensor, LCD display and servo motor, based on Microcontroller. To design a touch less hand sanitizer dispenser. 
  
## CONCLUSION 

      Although hand sanitizers do a great job of preventing the transmission of diseases, soap and water is the best way to eliminate  all forms of infectious bacteria.  It is a safe, effective, beneficial and overall chemical-free way of stopping transmission of diseases. It has a minimal amount of disadvantages and still proves to be one of the best methods.  

     It is important  to use the right sanitizer in the proper way.  Alcohol-containing hand  sanitizers are the most effective, and it must be used in a dime sized amount, spreading it all over your hands, between your fingers and covering all surface area.  This is the only way in which, hand sanitizers will fully complete its job and prevent the spread of diseases.
